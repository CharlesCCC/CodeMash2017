GraphQL is an open specification created by Facebook for exchanging data between a client and server. It turns REST on its head by letting the client ask for exactly the data it needs rather than the server sending whatever it thinks is best. In this talk, attendees will learn about what GraphQL is and the basic syntax. We’ll see how it works on the client and the server, and how it can be used to solve some of the most frustrating problems in modern web app development. We’ll also see how powerful features like schema introspection allow you to do things in web development we’ve never been able to do before. Expect to come away with a good understanding of where and how to harness GraphQL on your next project.
