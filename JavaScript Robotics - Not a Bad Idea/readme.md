JavaScript is seeing its renaissance right now. All the cool kids are coding JavaScript everywhere they can. But robotics? Really? Doesn’t that sound like a bad idea? I’d like to show you the opposite: why JavaScript robotics is NOT a bad idea! It turns out that the same things that make JavaScript great for the web also make JavaScript great for robotics. Enter Johnny-Five: a JavaScript robotics platform with beautiful abstractions. We’ll discover the power of Johnny-Five and explore the possibilities of controlling low-cost electronics to manipulate the real world with a much more accessible language than C/C++.
