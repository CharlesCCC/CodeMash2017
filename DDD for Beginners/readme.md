Domain Driven Design focusses on modelling the domain logic. This talk looks at the components of the model layer of your web application and the options you have. How are you supposed to organise your models in an MVC application? What goes where? What is a service class, a mapper or an entity? Weâ€™ll discuss the terminology and take a look at what Domain Driven Design is and see how you use service layer to provide the business logic for your application and hide your persistence code from your controllers. By the end of this session you will be equipped to create excellent, maintainable models in your projects.
