Underneath every breakout website or app is a horizontally scaling back-end, but how do we get from a single process Node.js server to a highly-available, auto-scaling system? In this talk, we’ll take a high level look at a full production stack before getting our hands dirty with the secret sauce: Node.js, WebSockets and Redis. Through a live coding demo, you’ll learn how to take a single-server app and scale it infinitely. Walk away with a better conceptual understanding of high-scale web systems and practical tools to start implementing these techniques in your own projects today.
