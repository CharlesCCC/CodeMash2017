You know the web app, the one started 6 years ago, before all of these cool new JS technologies came along. Creaking with a 3 year old copy of jQuery loaded down with 30 some plugins of code that is almost impenetrable. You would like to modernize it but you don’t even know where to start. You have a working site, and know the pitfalls of the dreaded “rewrite”. How do you integrate the new tooling along side what is already there and allow yourself to build something knew. Learn how you can integrate React seamlessly into a legacy web application. Have it slowly take on more responsibility as you let it become your new codebase.
