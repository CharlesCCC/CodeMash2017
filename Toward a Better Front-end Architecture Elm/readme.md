Amidst the overwhelming cacophony of competing JavaScript frameworks, Elm is a promising voice. Elm is a relatively new language that compiles to JavaScript. Elm is a functional language that encourages describing UI, state, and events in a declarative manner, while performing as good as or better than the current JavaScript framework hotness. With type safety and pure programming constructs, Elm promises code that has fewer bugs and is easier to reason about. In this talk, dive into Elm, exploring its syntax and more importantly its architecture. Learn about unidirectional data flow, modular and composable UI components, update functions, and commands and tasks for side effects. Ultimately, discover how functional programming with Elmâ€™s architecture can solve real problems. Leave this talk equipped to start utilizing Elm to construct non-trivial apps with more maintainable code and better determinism.
